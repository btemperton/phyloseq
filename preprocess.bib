  abstract = {Building on the successful Analysing Ecological Data (2007) by Zuur,
  Ieno and Smith, the authors now provide an expanded introduction
	to using regression and its extensions in analysing ecological data.
	As with the earlier book, real data sets from postgraduate ecological
	studies or research projects are used throughout. The first part
	of the book is a largely non-mathematical introduction to linear
	mixed effects modelling, GLM and GAM, zero inflated models, GEE,
	GLMM and GAMM. The second part provides ten case studies that range
	from koalas to deep sea research. These chapters provide an invaluable
	insight into analysing complex ecological datasets, including comparisons
	of different approaches to the same problem. By matching ecological
	questions and data structure to a case study, these chapters provide
	an excellent starting point to analysing your own data. Data and
	R code from all chapters are available from \url{http://www.highstat.com}.},
